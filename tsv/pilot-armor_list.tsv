UNCLEAR_END/NTT	"If you go unconscious or die while wearing this suit, a digitial consciousness of yourself animates your body. You're still unconscious (or dead) but can take 1 action and can't benefit from talents on your turn. You regain 5 HP and otherwise act as normal. If you go to 0 again, you are returned to a normal Down and Out state or death. This effect also wears off after the current challenge or about 10 minutes, and can't be activated again until you take a full repair. If dying caused this ability to trigger, you are dead once this effect wears off. The homunculus cannot respond to novel situations or stimuli, but in a familiar setting it interacts mostly as normal; this trends deep into the uncanny valley, and won't fool people into thinking that it's ""you""."	2	8	8	4	HORUS	2
UNAVOIDABLE_VOID	Causes errors in whatever prints it. Doesn't appear on electronic systems, is immune to system attacks, cannot be targeted by smart weapons or drones, and cannot be seen by NHPs or AIs (they treat you as permanently invisible).	1	10	-	4	HORUS	3

DJED Overarmor	When you go Down and Out, instead of rolling a check, you can activate this armor’s stasis system. Until the end of the current challenge, you are put into a stasis state where you cannot take damage, but also cannot move or take any actions (or be revived from this state). Once the challenge ends, roll for Down and Out as normal.	2	8	8	4	HA	3
