You can make a skirmish action as a free action at any point during your turn. This action can be made even if you already took the skirmish action, and you can still take the skirmish action if you made this free action While active, your mech automatically uses its movement to move towards the nearest target, friend or foe, and attempts to engage in melee combat, using all available actions to do so. If you end your turn while not in reach of a target (friend or foe), you become Impaired until you are. To end this protocol, you must pass a successful engineering check at the start of your turn. Otherwise, this protocol will continue until your mech is destroyed. Death or incapacitation of the pilot will not stop it.	IPS-N Blackbeard III
Throughbolt Rounds	1	-	Ammo	Choose 1 CQB, cannon, or rifle weapon. When you fire this weapon, draw a line 3 spaces long from your mech, then measure its original range from the end of this line as though the attack was fired from that position (also measure cover from this new position for the rest of the attack).

Restock Drone	2	-	Limited (2), Drone	As a quick action, you can set this drone down in any adjacent space. After your turn ends, the drone primes. Any allied mech that moves adjacent to the drone can activate it as an interaction. That mech can then cool 1d6 heat, reload all weapons with the loading tag, and gain 2d6 + your engineering in hit points. The drone is then consumed, deactivating and disintegrating.	IPS-N Lancaster I
Cable Winch System	1	-	Quick Action	As a quick action, you can attach the cables to an adjacent mech. If the mech is shut down, stunned, or a willing target, this action is automatically successful, otherwise it can make a hull check to resist this effect. Once attached, your mech and the attached mech cannot move more than 5 range away from each other. One mech can tow the other, but is crippled while doing so, and must successfully pass a hull check to do so. Any mech can take an action and make a successful hull check or melee or improvised attack to remove the cables (removed on a hit, the cables have evasion 10).

Your AI constructs a perfect, real-time, 3d model of this are that you can rotate and interact with, including actors that move in and out of that area, and extreme detail. Moving the area requires activating this protocol again, but it lasts until the end of the current challenge (or about 10 minutes in narrative time). Your mech gains perfect line of sight in this area and can relay this to allies, letting any attacks from yourself or allies in the area ignore light and heavy cover. Hostile targets that end their turn in this area lose invisibility or hiding, and you can see the current heat and HP levels of all targets in the area.	SSC Swallowtail III
Cloaking Field	4	-	2 heat (self), Quick Action	You can activate or deactivate the light bending properties of this module as a quick action. It lasts until the end your next turn.

FADE Cloak	2	-	Quick Action	When activated, you go out of phase with reality. You can ignore obstructions such as walls or cover, and pass through enemy mechs and solid objects as if they weren't there, but cannot end your turn in their space. You cannot interact with the world, but neither can it interact with you (in terms of damage, etc). If you are forced to return to normal space inside an object, instead take 2d6 AP Kinetic damage and return in the nearest available space. While this system is active, at the start of your turn roll a d6; on 4+ you remain out of phase, on a 3+ you return to the battlefield until the start of your next turn.

Any negative statuses caused by tech actions immediately end. Targets inside the zone don’t show up on any electronic sensors and are only visible to the naked eye or optics. The drone deactivates at the end of the current challenge or when destroyed, and cannot be re-used. You can move it again as a quick action.	SSC Black Witch II
Mag Deployer	2	-	Quick Action	You flash-print a heavy metal plate that takes up a 2x2 free space in range 5 of you. It is flat and doesn’t obstruct movement. You can set the system to one of two settings when you create it: Repulse: Any hostile target that enters the space must pass an hull check or be pushed in a direction of your choice 3 spaces. If this causes them to collide with an obstruction (terrain, a mech, etc) it is additionally knocked prone. An allied target that enters the space can fly 3 in any direction as a free action. Attract: Any target, allied or enemy, that enters the space, must pass a hull check or become immobilized. It can end this status by taking a quick action and repeating this check successfully to free itself. The deployer can be attacked - it has evasion 5, 20 hp, and 2 armor, and it lasts until the end of the current challenge or around an hour outside. You can only deploy one at at time.

Stasis Barrier	2	-	Limited (1), Shield, Deployable	This module deploys as a 4 space long piece of size 2 cover that lasts until the end of the current challenge. While behind the barrier, a target counts as having heavy cover and has resistance to all damage from blast, line, and cone attacks. At the end of the challenge, it deactivates and is used up. The cover itself is immune to all damage.	HA Napoleon I
Stasis Mine	1	-	Limited (1), Mine	You can detonate this mine with a quick action once planted (or it activates normally). Once detonated, this mine creates a burst 4 area around it. Affected targets may make an agility check with 1 difficulty to escape if on the edge, otherwise they are trapped inside. The area inside is locked from the normal flow of space time, creating an impermeable barrier around its edge. Effects, mechs, and pilots inside are stunned and removed from play until the end of next round, and all other effects cannot penetrate into the area. Time does not flow normally for targets inside the area (it stops completely), and is separate to the outside world. Active effects, attacks, modules, and other individuals and actions inside the area pause.

While active, the flow of time is altered drastically in a small sliver of space in a bubble around the user. Nothing, not even light, can enter or exit the shield. It is impermeable and invulnerable. When the shield is activated, mechs caught on the edge must make an agility check to choose which side they end up on, otherwise the user chooses. To those inside the shield, the world outside the shield goes totally black, and the inverse happens from outside. No action or effect can enter or exit the shield while it is active or draw line of sight though (even those that normally ignore it), though time passes normally on both sides. The shield drops automatically at the end of the user’s next turn.	HA Napoleon III
Reactor Stabilizer	2	Yes	-	When you gain your first point of reactor stress, you can re-roll your overheating check (but must keep the second result, even if it’s worse).	HA Sherman I

Repulser Field	1	Yes	Quick Action	You can use this system as a quick action to emit a burst 2 pulse around your mech. Targets caught in the area (allied or enemy) must pass a hull check or be knocked back directly away from you 3 spaces. The pulse then detonates any mines or explosives caught in the field.	HA Iskander I
Grounding Charge	2	-	Limited (2), Mine	This charge can also be detonated with an action. Once detonated, targets in a burst 6 area centered on the charge must make a successful hull check or be knocked prone and pulled as far as possible towards the charge as though they moved normally (starting with the closest target). The charge also pulls any flying mechs or vehicles within range 6 above the area that fail the check to the ground, making them roll for damage as if they fell.	HA Iskander III
Support Shield	2	Yes	Shield, Quick Action, 2 heat (self)	Activating this system generates a Burst 3 area centered on user until the end of the user’s next turn.
