    License: 'HA Iskander III'
    Name: 'Sticky Bomb Launcher'
    Notes: 'To fire this weapon, you can attack a point on the environment within
        range without rolling, or make a regular attack roll against a target within
        range. On a hit, the target or area does not take damage, but instead has
        a sticky bomb attached. It takes an action and a successful engineering check
        to remove all sticky bombs from an area or mech. As an end of round action,
        you can detonate all sticky bombs fired by this weapon to deal 1d6 explosive
        damage in blast 1 centered on all targeted mechs or areas. Mechs caught in
        the blast area can pass an agility check to halve this damage, but mechs ‘stuck’
        by this weapon fail their check automatically.'
