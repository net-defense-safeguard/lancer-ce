Armor: 2
Bonuses: 'If you go unconscious or die while wearing this suit, a digitial consciousness
  of yourself animates your body. You''re still unconscious (or dead) but can take
  1 action and can''t benefit from talents on your turn. You regain 5 HP and otherwise
  act as normal. If you go to 0 again, you are returned to a normal Down and Out state
  or death. This effect also wears off after the current challenge or about 10 minutes,
  and can''t be activated again until you take a full repair. If dying caused this
  ability to trigger, you are dead once this effect wears off. The homunculus cannot
  respond to novel situations or stimuli, but in a familiar setting it interacts mostly
  as normal; this trends deep into the uncanny valley, and won''t fool people into
  thinking that it''s "you".'
