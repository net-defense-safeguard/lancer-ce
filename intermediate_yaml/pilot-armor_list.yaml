        Down and Out state or death. This effect also wears off after the current
        challenge or about 10 minutes, and can''t be activated again until you take
        a full repair. If dying caused this ability to trigger, you are dead once
        this effect wears off. The homunculus cannot respond to novel situations or
        stimuli, but in a familiar setting it interacts mostly as normal; this trends
        deep into the uncanny valley, and won''t fool people into thinking that it''s
