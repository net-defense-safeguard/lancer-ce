Description: 'Once activated, the suit can put an individual into a state of human
  hibernation for 3 hours and up to 6 months, lowering their vital signs to almost
  nothing, relieving them of the need for food, air, or sleep, and halting the process
  of any diseases. During the first 10 minutes, the suit extrudes a hardened polymer
  around the sleeper, protecting them from impact and making them resistant to all
  damage.'
