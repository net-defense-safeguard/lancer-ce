Description: 'This shield can be deployed as an action in a free adjacent space. Once
  deployed, it creates a burst 2 zone around it. Ranged attacks against all non-mech
  targets size Â½ or smaller in the zone suffer from +1 difficulty. The shield deactivates
  after the current challenge and must recharge on a full repair.'
