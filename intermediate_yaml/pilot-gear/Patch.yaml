Description: '1 Use: ‘Patch’ is a catch all term for sprayable medi-gel, instant-acting
  medical patches, or other first aid gear. Using a patch takes two actions and restores
  ½ your pilot’s HP (round up). It can be used on another adjacent pilot for the same
  effects, and although it can heal a down and out pilot, it won’t bring them back
  to consciousness. Has no effect on mechs'
