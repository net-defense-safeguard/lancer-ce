Description: 'With this implant, you can hand complete control of your body’s motor
  functions over to an NHP, allowing you to sleep, rest, or relax while it performs
  tasks. It’s not skilled enough to pilot a mech in combat or perform very complex
  tasks, but it can pilot your mech out of combat and perform certain tasks or work
  such as cooking, administrative work, data entry, mech repair, piloting a ship or
  driving, or other mundane tasks. It can also imitate you and your personality fairly
  well, though not to a degree that someone who knows you well would be fooled in
  the slightest.'
