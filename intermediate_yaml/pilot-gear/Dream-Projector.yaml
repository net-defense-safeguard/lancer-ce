Description: 'This small, puck-like system can be deployed or thrown to a point within
  range 4 as an action and remotely activated as another action. While deployed and
  active, it can project extremely convincing holographic images within 2 spaces of
  its location of nearly any size that could fit in that space. If inspected closely,
  a Tech or Swindle pilot action might be required to maintain the illusion.'
