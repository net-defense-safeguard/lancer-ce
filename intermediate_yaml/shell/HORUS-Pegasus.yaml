Ultimate-Active: 'Unshackle Ushabti: For the rest of this combat, you can fire your
  omnigun up to 3 times per turn instead of just once.'
Ultimate-Name: 'Ushabti Omnigun'
Ultimate-Passive: 'Your mech mounts an omnigun, a weapon and piece of experimental
  hardware so advanced that it does not classify as any weapon weight or type (so
  it cannot be modified or benefit from talents). It also doesnâ€™t take a mount. Once,
  at any point during your turn, you can hit a target in range 30 with the omnigun
  as a free action, dealing 1 AP kinetic damage. This does not count as an attack,
  cannot miss, does not need line of sight, ignores cover, and this damage cannot
  be reduced by any means.'
