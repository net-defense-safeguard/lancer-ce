Ultimate-Active: 'Convert to Battery (Action): While this is active, you have the
  following drawbacks: Your mech is immobilized, cannot directly attack a target within
  range 5, and can only make attacks with the weapon mounted in your Apocalypse Rail.
  However, you are immune to knockback and being knocked prone, you cannot be moved
  by a target smaller than you(such as a grapple), you have resistance to Heat, and
  the weapon mounted in your Apocalypse Rail can be fired twice with the barrage action
  instead of just once. If it has the Loading tag, it can still be fired twice, but
  must be reloaded normally after.'
Ultimate-Name: 'Apocalypse Rail'
Ultimate-Passive: 'Your mech has the apocalypse rail, a weapon mount that takes a
  superheavy or smaller sized weapon. You can still mount smaller weapons on the apocalypse
  rail. You donâ€™t need an additional mount to add superheavy weapon to this mount.
  This mount is not modifiable(such as from core bonuses).'
