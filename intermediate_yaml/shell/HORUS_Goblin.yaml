Ultimate-Active: 'Your mech targets another adjacent NPC mech the same size or larger
  that is shut down or destroyed. The targeted mech cannot have the Ultra or Elite
  tags. Your mech clamps on to that mech and retracts its core systems, becoming like
  a vestigial blister on that mech. The mech immediately heals to full HP, clears
  1 point of stress and structure damage, and clears all heat, though it retains any
  other damage it has already taken. Your mech’s systems completely consume the other
  mech’s core systems for a time, granting you total control of your target, even
  if the other mech’s pilot is still alive. While you control your target, you take
  action as that NPC would, counting as a friendly NPC that has already acted in the
  turn you take control. While controlling your target, your GOBLIN can be targeted
  and damaged separate from the mech it’s controlling. It beneﬁts from light cover
  while attached. If you take 1 point of structure damage, your mech detaches and
  control is immediately lost. Otherwise you can control the target up to a maximum
  of a ten minutes, when your target is destroyed, or when you deactivate this system.
  You can even control your target if the other pilot is missing or dead.'
