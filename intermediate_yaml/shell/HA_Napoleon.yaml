Ultimate-Active: 'Activate Aegis (Action): A shimmering, utterly black field envelops
  your mech, covering it like a second skin, and taking only a few moments to activate.
  While this field is active, your mech reduces all damage from any source to 1, though
  it can still be grabbed, knocked back, pinned, thrown, and affected by other mechs.
  While this shield is active, your mech can only make the grapple, improvised attack,
  ram, boost, and stabilize systems actions. It cannot take free actions, reactions,
  or overcharge, and cannot fly(If flying, it falls). It cannot activate systems,
  though it can interact normally with the world otherwise. It cannot benefit from,
  be the target of, or make tech actions (including lock on, etc), and cannot communicate
  or receive communications with or from anyone except the GM (though hand signals
  are still possible). The shield lasts until the end of the current challenge, or
  about an hour otherwise. Damage that goes through reduction (such as paracausal
  ammo) can still harm the Napoleon while its aegis is up.'
Ultimate-Name: 'HA Vantablack Aegis'
Ultimate-Passive: 'If you would take half damage from an effect (weapon, system, explosion,
  etc) on a successful check of any kind, you instead take 0 damage.'
