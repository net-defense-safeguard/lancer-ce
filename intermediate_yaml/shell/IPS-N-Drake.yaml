Ultimate-Active: 'Fortress (1 core power, Protocol): When you activate this protocol,
  you plant your shield and deploy stabilizers, becoming more like a fortified emplacement
  than a mech. While this system is active, your mech is Immobilized, though you can
  still rotate and aim in any direction. You are immune to being knocked back, rammed,
  grappled, or involuntarily moved by any reason. Two line 2 sections of heavy cover
  unfold, drawn from your mech in any direction. Your mech grants heavy cover for
  allied mechs while this system is active, has heavy cover itself, has resistance
  to damage from blast, line, and cone attacks, and also grants this resistance to
  any mechs making use of its cover. This system can be deactivated at the start of
  your turn but cannot be reactivated without more core power.'
Ultimate-Name: 'IPS-N Argonaut Shield'
Ultimate-Passive: 'This huge, plated shield can be used to bash enemies. It counts
  as its own mount (doesnâ€™t take mount space). Main Melee, Threat 1, 1d6 Kinetic Damage.'
