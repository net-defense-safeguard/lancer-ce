Ultimate-Active: 'OROCHI mode (Quick Action): Your mech has been heavily modified,
  and a large number of its subsystems and structure are controlled by semi-autonomous
  drones. Choose up to 3 weapons or systems on your mech. As an action, these parts
  of your mech can split off and become autonomous units. They are size 1, have evasion
  equal to your evasion, have hp equal to your HP, 1 structure, and heat capacity
  equal to your heat capacity. They inherit your speed and other mech stats. On your
  turn, they can move, take the activate system, and skirmish actions, but no other
  actions. If they overheat or go to 0HP, they are destroyed, and if they are destroyed,
  the associate weapon or system is also destroyed (it can be repaired as normal during
  a rest). You can re-unite any parts of your mech as an action, but inherit any heat
  they currently have, and cannot deploy them again without taking the special action
  as part of this system. '
Ultimate-Name: 'OROCHI Disarticulation'
Ultimate-Passive: 'Your NHP partitions itself into many cloned personalities that
  can help you with maintaining your mech. Once per round, you can re-roll any systems
  or engineering check of your choice, but must keep the second result.'
