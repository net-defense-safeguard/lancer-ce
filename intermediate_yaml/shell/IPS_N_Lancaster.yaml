Ultimate-Active: 'Supercharger (1 core power, quick action): You fire your drone at
  a friendly mech in range, where it clamps onto the target. For the rest of this
  combat, you take 1 heat at the start of your turn, but the targeted mech gains +1
  Accuracy on all attacks and checks, and is immune to the impaired, jammed, crippled,
  and immobilized conditions. This effect ends if you or the targeted mech is stunned
  or shut down. While this system is active, you cannot fire your drone as a weapon
  (using the passive of this system).'
Ultimate-Name: 'Latch Drone'
Ultimate-Passive: 'You can send out this companion drone as a weapon system with the
  following profile. It counts as its own mount and doesnâ€™t take up regular mount
  space. Auxillary Launcher, Range 8. Make a Targeting roll vs Evasion 8 and target
  any friendly mech in range(still take cover and LoS into account). On hit, the target
  may spend up to 1 repair to heal.'
