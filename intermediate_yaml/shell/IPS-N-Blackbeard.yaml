Ultimate-Active: 'Omni-Harpoon (1 core power, Action): This one-shot system fires
  harpoon-like grapples at any number of targets within line of sight and within range
  5. Those targets must pass a hull check with 1 difficulty or be knocked prone and
  pulled adjacent to your mech, or as far as possible towards your mech without being
  obstructed. All targets are then immobilized until the end of your next turn'
Ultimate-Name: 'Assault Grapples'
Ultimate-Passive: 'As a full action, your mech can fire the assault grapples at any
  surface in range 8 (even vertical or overhanging), pulling your mech in a straight
  line to that location as long as your mech is not obstructed during that movement.
  Your mech can hold on to that location as long as it remains immobile. Your mech
  can also use this system to attempt to grapple and maintain a grapple on any target
  within range 8, instead of being adjacent to that target.'
