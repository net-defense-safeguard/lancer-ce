Ultimate-Active: 'Mag Field (1 core power): As an action, activate the mag field to
  create a Blast 4 area with at least one square adjacent to you. Inside, ranged weapon
  attacks that deal kinetic or explosive damage cannot penetrate into or out of the
  field and deal no damage (keep track of them). The field is difficult terrain for
  all mechs and vehicles made at least partly of metal. Targets that start their turn
  in the Mag Field or enter it for the first time must make a successful Engineering
  chec with 1 difficulty or be pulled to the center and immobilized. You can repeat
  this check at the start of your turns while trapped this way, and can move normally
  on a success, otherwise you remain trapped. The field persists for 3 round after
  deployment. At the end of the third round, any attacks fired into the field resume
  trajectory towards the center of the zone; the GM rolls a single attack roll versus
  each target still inside the zone with +1 targeting per attack fired into the zone
  (max +6). Successful hits deal 1d6 Kinetic per attack (cumulative). Then, the zone
  deactivates.'
Ultimate-Name: 'Mag Projector'
Ultimate-Passive: 'Once per turn, you can attempt to parry any attack that hits your
  mech as a reaction. Roll a d6; on a 6, reduce the damage from that attack to 0,
  and deal 1d6 heat back to your attacker.'
