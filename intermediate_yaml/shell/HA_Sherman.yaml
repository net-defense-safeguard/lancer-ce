Ultimate-Active: 'COREBURN Beam (Full Action): As an action, your mech begins to charge
  this weapon but cannot move or take any other action this turn. Your mech stops
  charging this weapon if it becomes stunned, shut down, jammed, knocked prone, or
  any effect that would cause it to be unable to attack (if it is unable to fire,
  don’t spend the core power). The turn after you start charging this weapon, you
  may fire it by taking 2 actions again. Choose a line 30 area originating from your
  mech. All mechs caught in the area must pass an engineering check or take 12d6 energy
  damage, and half on a successful check. Any obstacles or deployables in the way
  are hit automatically and this weapon obliterates incidental or light cover, obstacles,
  non-reinforced walls, etc. After firing this weapon, your mech takes 1d6 heat.'
