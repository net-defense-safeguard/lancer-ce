Ultimate-Active: 'Meta-State Paralysis (Action): Your mech projects a horrifying Basilisk
  pattern, incredibly harmful to NHPs, software, and hard to look at even for humans
  (typically causes 5-8 hours of headaches and intense subdermal bleeding, can often
  cause blood vessels to pop in the eye). Until the end of the current combat, any
  target that attacks either you or any ally within range 5 of you must first pass
  a systems(or GRIT) check or be stunned until the end of their next turn. A target
  can only be stunned once by this effect per combat.'
Ultimate-Name: 'Harnessed Basilisk'
Ultimate-Passive: 'Any attacker that rolls a 1 or 2 on their d20 roll to attack you
  is automatically stunned until the end of their next turn (their attack also automatically
  misses).'
