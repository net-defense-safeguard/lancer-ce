Ultimate-Active: 'Death Cloud (action): As an action, your mech fires an enormous
  expanding cloud of micro-mines across the whole battlefield. Any mech on the whole
  battlefield (or a roughly 50x50x50 area), allied or enemy, that moves more than
  1 space must first pass an engineering check. If they fail that check, they take
  3 AP explosive damage, but can move normally. If a mech boosts, it automatically
  takes 3 AP explosive damage (no check allowed). Mechs are aware of the presence
  of the mines. They last until the end of 3 rounds, counting this one, then deactivate.
  You do not activate mines from this system.'
Ultimate-Name: 'Broad-Sweep Seeder'
Ultimate-Passive: 'Your mech cannot activate mines (allied or enemy) or systems that
  activate once a hostile target comes within range unless it chooses to do soWhen
  your mech uses a quick action to plant a mine, you may plant up to 2 additional
  mines in free adjacent spaces as a free action.'
