Ultimate-Active: 'Maze (2 actions): You hurl an opposing mechâ€™s systems into a metaphysical
  information trap so tangled that it can do nothing but try and escape it. Choose
  a target of your choice that can be affected by tech actions within your sensor
  range. That target must pass a systems check with 4 difficulty or become stunned
  as its systems start to figure out the trap you have thrown it in. At the start
  of its next turn (and on subsequent turns), it can repeat this check, this time
  with only 3 difficulty, ending the stun on itself on a success. It gains +1 accuracy
  on its check each time it repeats this check until it is successful. Otherwise it
  remains stunned.'
Ultimate-Name: 'Metafold Maze'
Ultimate-Passive: 'You can spend a quick action after any successful hostile tech
  action to cripple your target until the start of your next turn. If your target
  is already crippled, they become immobilized. If they are already immobilized, they
  are stunned until the end of your next turn. This passive can only stun the same
  target once per combat, but cripple or immobilize them any number of times'
