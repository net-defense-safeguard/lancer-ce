Ultimate-Active: 'Active (Protocol): Your mech crackles with energy. For the rest
  of this combat your mech has resistance to heat from any source (round up). Set
  aside a charge die, starting at 1. When you take heat (from any source, even self),
  increase the die by 1, to a maximum of 6. You can discharge the accumulated energy
  in a burst 2 area around you by taking an action to do so. This deals 1d6 energy
  damage to all targets caught inside, allied or enemy, per charge on the die, and
  affected mechs can pass a system check to halve the damage. This system then deactivates
  for the remainder of combat, including its passive.'
Ultimate-Name: 'Charged Exoskeleton'
Ultimate-Passive: 'When you take heat damage from any source, one target in range
  3 of you takes 1 energy damage.'
