Ultimate-Active: 'Divine Punishment (1 core power, Full Action): You unload your Avenger
  silos. All targets of your choice on the battlefield (or range 50) must pass an
  agility check with 1 difficulty or take 1d6+3 explosive damage, and half on a successful
  save. You do not need line of sight to any targets, and the self-guiding missiles
  can perfectly seek any target as long as they can trace a path. Once used, you cannot
  benefit from the passive of this system until you take a full repair'

Ultimate-Passive: 'When you score a critical hit with a Launcher weapon, a target
  different to your first target in range and LoS takes 2 Explosive damage, no roll
  required.'
