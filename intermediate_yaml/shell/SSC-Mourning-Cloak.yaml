Ultimate-Active: 'Stabilize Singularity (1 core power, Protocol): Until the end of
  this challenge, when you move or boost, you instead teleport up to the same distance'
Ultimate-Name: 'EX Slipstream Module'
Ultimate-Passive: 'This dangerous and experimental module is a miniaturized starship
  nearlight drive. You can use it instead of moving or taking the boost action. When
  you use it, roll 3d6. You can teleport to a point within that range around you as
  long as there is space for your mech. You donâ€™t have to be able to see this point,
  but if you attempt to teleport to an already occupied space (by terrain, another
  mech, etc), the teleport fails and you take 2d6 kinetic damage. If you roll triples
  for this system, your mech disappears and does not re-appear, either indefinitely
  or until your party rests (up to you).'
