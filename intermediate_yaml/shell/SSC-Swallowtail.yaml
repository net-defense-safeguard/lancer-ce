Ultimate-Active: 'Prophetic Interjection (1 core power): Until the end of the current
  challenge, once per round, as a reaction when an allied target you can see is damaged
  by another target you can see, you can  ake a systems check. On success, the attack
  hitting was actually a simulation that your mech predicted. Your ally gains resistance
  to all the damage from that attack, and your ally can move 3 in any direction to
  where they ‘actually’ were. This movement does not provoke reactions and ignores
  engagement.'
Ultimate-Name: 'Cloudscout TACSIM swarms'
Ultimate-Passive: 'Gain +1 Accuracy to all agility checks against effects you can
  see or are aware of. If you can’t see a target when it attacks you (it’s invisible
  or hiding, for example), you don’t gain this benefit.'
