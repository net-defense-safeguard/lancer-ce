Ultimate-Active: 'Empower Shield (Action): You can empower this shield, projecting
  it over an ally in your sensor range. As long as they remain in your sensor range,
  they also benefit from your shieldâ€™s passive. In addition, once per round, when
  an attack roll misses either you or the target of this shield, you can force the
  attacker to repeat the attack roll against a target of your choice within range
  (even a target allied to your attacker). This effect lasts until the end of the
  current challenge, and you can swap your target by taking this action again.'
Ultimate-Name: 'Tachyon Loop'
