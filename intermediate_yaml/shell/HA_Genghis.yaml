Ultimate-Active: 'Expose Power Cells (Action): You ignore the next overheating check
  you make this challenge. When you would overheat, clear your heat from your gauge
  as normal, but ignore the check (you donâ€™t take stress either). You vent an enormous
  cloud of burning matter from your mech, creating a burst 3 area centered on your
  mech. Inside the area, all targets (allied and enemy) count as invisible to everyone
  except you, and all mechs other than you that enter the area for the first time
  on their turn or start their turn there take 2 Burn and 2 heat. On the following
  round, the benefit from the area reduces to heavy cover (which you ignore). On the
  round after that, it reduces to light cover. On the round after that round, the
  zone disperses.'
