Effect: 'You can detonate this mine with a quick action once planted (or it activates
  normally). Once detonated, this mine creates a burst 4 area around it. Affected
  targets may make an agility check with 1 difficulty to escape if on the edge, otherwise
  they are trapped inside. The area inside is locked from the normal flow of space
  time, creating an impermeable barrier around its edge. Effects, mechs, and pilots
  inside are stunned and removed from play until the end of next round, and all other
  effects cannot penetrate into the area. Time does not flow normally for targets
  inside the area (it stops completely), and is separate to the outside world. Active
  effects, attacks, modules, and other individuals and actions inside the area pause.
  At the end of the the next round (after all characters have acted), this area returns
  and resumes play as normal.'
