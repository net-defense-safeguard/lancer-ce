Effect: 'You fire an ICEOUT drone at a point within range 10 of you, where it hovers
  in place. The drone is invisible. Once fired, the drone creates a burst 2 zone around
  itself. Any target at least partially covered by the zone, allied or enemy, is immune
  to all tech actions (even beneficial ones), and cannot make or benefit from any
  tech actions. Any negative statuses caused by tech actions immediately end. Targets
  inside the zone donâ€™t show up on any electronic sensors and are only visible to
  the naked eye or optics. The drone deactivates at the end of the current challenge
  or when destroyed, and cannot be re-used. You can move it again as a quick action.'
