Effect: 'Your mech has a basic companion/concierge unit installed in it. It can speak
  to you and has a personality but is not truly capable of independent thought, as
  a true AI would be. It is obedient to you alone. It can take actions and move on
  its own prerogative when not piloted, using its stats, but has no independent initiative
  (it must take and follow commands from you, or else takes no action other than to
  defend itself). It is controlled by the GM and gains its own set of actions (but
  acts on your turn), and cannot benefit from any of your talents. Dummy Plugs are
  not true AIs and thus cannot be unshackled.'
