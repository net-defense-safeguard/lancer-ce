Effect: 'This module deploys as a 4 space long piece of size 2 cover that lasts until
  the end of the current challenge. While behind the barrier, a target counts as having
  heavy cover and has resistance to all damage from blast, line, and cone attacks.
  At the end of the challenge, it deactivates and is used up. The cover itself is
  immune to all damage.'
