Effect: 'Choose 1 CQB, cannon, or rifle weapon. When you fire this weapon, draw a
  line 3 spaces long from your mech, then measure its original range from the end
  of this line as though the attack was fired from that position (also measure cover
  from this new position for the rest of the attack). This line can easily punch through
  walls or other barriers. Any targets hit by this line are also hit by the attack
  (ignoring cover). The attack cannot change directions after being fired.'
