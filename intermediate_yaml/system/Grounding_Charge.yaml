Effect: 'This charge can also be detonated with an action. Once detonated, targets
  in a burst 6 area centered on the charge must make a successful hull check or be
  knocked prone and pulled as far as possible towards the charge as though they moved
  normally (starting with the closest target). The charge also pulls any flying mechs
  or vehicles within range 6 above the area that fail the check to the ground, making
  them roll for damage as if they fell.'
