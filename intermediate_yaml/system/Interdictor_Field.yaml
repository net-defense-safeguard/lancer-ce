Effect: 'You can activate or deactivate this field as a quick action. Once activated,
  at the start of your next turn, it creates a burst 3 area around your mech that
  becomes both dangerous and difficult terrain for hostile targets (requires a systems
  check to navigate or they take 5 kinetic damage). Your mech is immobilized while
  this field is active, and the field and immobilization remains until you take a
  quick action to deactivate it. Allied targets are not affected.'
