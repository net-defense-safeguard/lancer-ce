Effect: 'As a quick action, you can attach the cables to an adjacent mech. If the
  mech is shut down, stunned, or a willing target, this action is automatically successful,
  otherwise it can make a hull check to resist this effect. Once attached, your mech
  and the attached mech cannot move more than 5 range away from each other. One mech
  can tow the other, but is crippled while doing so, and must successfully pass a
  hull check to do so. Any mech can take an action and make a successful hull check
  or melee or improvised attack to remove the cables (removed on a hit, the cables
  have evasion 10). The cables can also be attached to the environment or any object.
  They are 10 length when used this way and can take a combined size of 6 in strain
  if using them to climb, etc, before they break.'
