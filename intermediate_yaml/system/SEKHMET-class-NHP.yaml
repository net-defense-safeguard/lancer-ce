Effect: 'Your mech gains the AI property. In addition, gain the SEKHMET protocol:
  Protocol All melee critical hits do +1d6 bonus damage. You can make a skirmish action
  as a free action at any point during your turn. This action can be made even if
  you already took the skirmish action, and you can still take the skirmish action
  if you made this free action While active, your mech automatically uses its movement
  to move towards the nearest target, friend or foe, and attempts to engage in melee
  combat, using all available actions to do so. If you end your turn while not in
  reach of a target (friend or foe), you become Impaired until you are. To end this
  protocol, you must pass a successful engineering check at the start of your turn.
  Otherwise, this protocol will continue until your mech is destroyed. Death or incapacitation
  of the pilot will not stop it.'
