Cost: 2
Effect: 'This brutal system can be used against any adjacent target. That target must
  pass an hull check with 1 difficulty or take 2d6 energy damage damage and become
  immobilized and impaled. At the end of each of its turns, the target can repeat
  this check to end the effect on itself, otherwise it takes 3 AP energy damage and
  remains immobilized until it makes the check successfully. Only one target can be
  immobilized by this system at once, but it can be re-used and picked up as an quick
  action.'
