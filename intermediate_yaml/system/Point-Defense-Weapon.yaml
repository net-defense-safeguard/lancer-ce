Effect: 'You can prime your PDW by taking a quick action. Roll 1d3, and gain that
  many charges. You can use a reaction while you have charges to spend 1 charge when
  any mech in your sensor range is attacked by a weapon with the smart, nexus, or
  launcher tag to completely nullify that attack (it automatically misses). You lose
  these charges at the start of your next turn.'
