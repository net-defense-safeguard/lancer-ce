Effect: 'Gain the following quick tech option: Link: Choose a friendly target in sensor
  range. You link systems with that target. From hereon, you can count that targetâ€™s
  sensor range as your sensor range for the purposes of tech actions, etc. In addition,
  you can make system skill checks for your target as a reaction, using your systems
  score. However, you both suffer the effects from any failed check (heat, statuses,
  etc). You can only link systems with one target at a time, and the effect ends if
  your target moves out of your sensor range.'
