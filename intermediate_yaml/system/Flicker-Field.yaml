Effect: 'When you move or boost, you project a holographic pattern around your mech
  that leaves dazzling afterimages, making it hard to discern your mech’s location.
  After moving or boosting you count as having invisibility against the very next
  attack roll against you. The field disperses after this attack, hit or miss. You
  can only gain the effect of this field once (you can’t ‘stack’ up several instances
  of it).'
