Effect: 'You can fire this drone to an empty space as a quick action. While itâ€™s active,
  it emits a burst 1 area around it that grants light cover to any allied mech at
  least partially covered by the zone (it benefits from its own cover). In addition,
  any hostile target that starts its turn in the area or enters it for the first time
  on their turn takes 1 AP kinetic damage. You can move it to a different space in
  your sensor range by repeating this action.'
