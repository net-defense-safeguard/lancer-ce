Effect: "As a quick action, this system creates a line 4 force field 4 spaces high\
  \ with at least 1 square in an adjacent space to you. Any adjacent mech can use\
  \ this force field for heavy cover from\nattacks on the other side. It additionally\
  \ gains resistance to kinetic and explosive damage from attacks on the other side\
  \ of this field, but conversely, any of its targets on the other side of the forcefield\
  \ gain resistance to kinetic and explosive damage from its attacks. The shield lasts\
  \ until the end of the current challenge, but only 1 shield can be placed at a time."
