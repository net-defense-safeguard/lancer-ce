Effect: 'Your mech gains the AI property and the TLALOC protocol. TLALOC protocol
  Protocol 2 heat (self). Your mech is capable of rapidly firing and re-targeting
  your weapons, far faster than you can think. When you activate this protocol, your
  mech is immobilized until the start of your next turn, but if you miss any weapon
  attack, you can immediately re-roll the attack as long as you target a different
  target in range or area of effect (if the attack was blast, line, or cone). You
  can take this re-roll only once for each attack (if the second attack misses you
  donâ€™t get to keep making it), and a target already hit by this attack (from a re-roll
  or otherwise) cannot be targeted again.'
