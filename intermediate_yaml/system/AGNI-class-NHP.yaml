  (1): For 3 rounds, at the end of your turn, you automatically cool, clearing your
  heat gauge. This vent creates a burst 3 zone around you. All targets within that
  zone must make an engineering skill check. On a failure, a target takes 2 Burn and
  is pushed outside the zone. This area provides light cover until the end of the
  next round. This protocol can only be activated once per challenge.'
