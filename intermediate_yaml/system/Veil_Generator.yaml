Effect: 'Once deployed in a free adjacent space as a quick action, this size 1 generator
  creates a weak cloaking field. It creates a burst 3 zone around in until the end
  of the current challenge. This zone doesnâ€™t move, but allied mechs inside count
  as in light cover and are immune to all tech actions (even friendly ones). Once
  deployed, this generator continues to run until out of charge and cannot be re-used
  or re-deployed. It benefits from its own field and has 2 armor.'
