Effect: 'When activated, you go out of phase with reality. You can ignore obstructions
  such as walls or cover, and pass through enemy mechs and solid objects as if they
  weren''t there, but cannot end your turn in their space. You cannot interact with
  the world, but neither can it interact with you (in terms of damage, etc). If you
  are forced to return to normal space inside an object, instead take 2d6 AP Kinetic
  damage and return in the nearest available space. While this system is active, at
  the start of your turn roll a d6; on 4+ you remain out of phase, on a 3+ you return
  to the battlefield until the start of your next turn. This drive deactivates if
  you make an overheating check, deactivate it at the start of your turn as a free
  action, or rest.'
