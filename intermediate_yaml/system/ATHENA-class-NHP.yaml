Effect: 'Your mech gains the AI property and gains the ATHENA protocol: ATHENA protocol
  Quick Action 3 heat (self). Choose a blast 4 area within 1 mile of you. Your AI
  constructs a perfect, real-time, 3d model of this are that you can rotate and interact
  with, including actors that move in and out of that area, and extreme detail. Moving
  the area requires activating this protocol again, but it lasts until the end of
  the current challenge (or about 10 minutes in narrative time). Your mech gains perfect
  line of sight in this area and can relay this to allies, letting any attacks from
  yourself or allies in the area ignore light and heavy cover. Hostile targets that
  end their turn in this area lose invisibility or hiding, and you can see the current
  heat and HP levels of all targets in the area.'
