Effect: 'As a full action, this system can be activated to generate a burst 4 area
  centered on user. While active, the flow of time is altered drastically in a small
  sliver of space in a bubble around the user. Nothing, not even light, can enter
  or exit the shield. It is impermeable and invulnerable. When the shield is activated,
  mechs caught on the edge must make an agility check to choose which side they end
  up on, otherwise the user chooses. To those inside the shield, the world outside
  the shield goes totally black, and the inverse happens from outside. No action or
  effect can enter or exit the shield while it is active or draw line of sight though
  (even those that normally ignore it), though time passes normally on both sides.
  The shield drops automatically at the end of the userâ€™s next turn.'
