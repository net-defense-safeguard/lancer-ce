Effect: 'You flash-print a heavy metal plate that takes up a 2x2 free space in range
  5 of you. It is flat and doesnâ€™t obstruct movement. You can set the system to one
  of two settings when you create it: Repulse: Any hostile target that enters the
  space must pass an hull check or be pushed in a direction of your choice 3 spaces.
  If this causes them to collide with an obstruction (terrain, a mech, etc) it is
  additionally knocked prone. An allied target that enters the space can fly 3 in
  any direction as a free action. Attract: Any target, allied or enemy, that enters
  the space, must pass a hull check or become immobilized. It can end this status
  by taking a quick action and repeating this check successfully to free itself. The
  deployer can be attacked - it has evasion 5, 20 hp, and 2 armor, and it lasts until
  the end of the current challenge or around an hour outside. You can only deploy
  one at at time. If you create a new deployer, the old one disintegrates and is destroyed.'
