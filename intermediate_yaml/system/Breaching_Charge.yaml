Effect: 'If thrown as a quick action, the charge explodes on impact. If planted as
  a mine, it can be detonated as another quick action by whoever planted it (or detonates
  normally when a target moves adjacent). The charge deals 2d6 Energy damage to targets
  in a burst 1 area around the charge. Targets can pass an agility check to reduce
  this damage by half. This charge deals double damage to objects and gains the AP
  tag against objects.'
