Effect: 'As a quick action, you can set this drone down in any adjacent space. After
  your turn ends, the drone primes. Any allied mech that moves adjacent to the drone
  can activate it as an interaction. That mech can then cool 1d6 heat, reload all
  weapons with the loading tag, and gain 2d6 + your engineering in hit points. The
  drone is then consumed, deactivating and disintegrating.'
