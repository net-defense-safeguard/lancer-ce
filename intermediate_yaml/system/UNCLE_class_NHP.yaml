Cost: 3
Effect: 'Choose 1 weapon - The weapon and its associate systems gain an NHP that has
  control over that specific weapon. This is not a full AI and can’t control your
  mech or become unshackled (and doesn’t have the AI tag). The weapon gains the unreliable
  tag (if this tag triggers, it is because the weapon’s personality is not cooperating).
  It can attack by itself once on your turn as a free action, using the mech’s targeting
  but with +1 Difficulty. It can’t fire a weapon that has already been fired this
  turn.'
