Damage: "-"
License: 'HA Iskander III'
Name: 'Sticky Bomb Launcher'
Notes: 'To fire this weapon, you can attack a point on the environment within range
  without rolling, or make a regular attack roll against a target within range. On
  a hit, the target or area does not take damage, but instead has a sticky bomb attached.
  It takes an action and a successful engineering check to remove all sticky bombs
  from an area or mech. As an end of round action, you can detonate all sticky bombs
  fired by this weapon to deal 1d6 explosive damage in blast 1 centered on all targeted
  mechs or areas. Mechs caught in the blast area can pass an agility check to halve
  this damage, but mechs ‘stuck’ by this weapon fail their check automatically.'
