# lancer-ce
Unofficial community resource compilation revolving around the wonderful Lancer mecha RPG by Miguel Lopez and Tom Parkinson Morgan.
The goal is to have a YAML repository of human- and machine- readable version of Lancer's more modular aspects, such as weapons, systems, and gear.
That being said, it is pending permission to host the game data publicly.
